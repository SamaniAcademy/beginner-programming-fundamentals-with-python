# Perfect Numbers (★★✩✩✩) 
By definition, a natural number is called a perfect number if its value is equal to the sum of its real divisors. This is true, for example, for the numbers 6 and 28:
```
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28
```
Write function calc_perfect_numbers(max_exclusive) that calculates the perfect numbers up to a maximum value, say 10,000.
