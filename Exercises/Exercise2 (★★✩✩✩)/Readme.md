# Statistics (★★✩✩✩)
Count as well as sum up the natural numbers that are divisible by 2 or 7 up to a given maximum value (exclusive) and output it to the console. Write function calc_sum_and_ count_all_numbers_div_by_2_or_7(max_exclusive). Extend it so that it returns the two values instead of performing the console output.

## Examples
|Maximum| Divisible by 2| Divisible by 7| Result Count |Sum|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|3| 2| -/-| 1| 2|
|8 |2, 4, 6| 7| 4| 19|
|15| 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 |7, 14| 8| 63|
