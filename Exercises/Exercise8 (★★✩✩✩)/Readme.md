# Armstrong Numbers (★★✩✩✩)
This exercise deals with three-digit Armstrong numbers. By definition, these are numbers for whose digits x, y, and z from 1 to 9 satisfy the following equation:
x*100 + y*10 + z = x^3 + y^3 + z^3
Write function calc_armstrong_numbers() to compute all Armstrong numbers for x, y, and z (each < 10).

## Examples
153 = 1*100 + 5*10 + 3*1 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
