# Prime Numbers (★★✩✩✩)
Write function calc_primes_up_to(max_value) to compute all prime numbers up to a given value. As a reminder, a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 and exclusively divisible by itself and by 1. To compute a prime number, the Sieve of Eratosthenes was described before.

## Examples
Check your algorithm with the following values: 
|Input| Result|
|---|---|
|15| [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]|
|25| [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]|
|50| [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]|
