## CH_Bonus4: Pascal’s Triangle
Write function pascal(n) that computes Pascal’s triangle in terms of nested lists. As you
know, each new line results from the previous one. If there are more than two elements
in it, two values are added and the sums build the values of the new line. In each case, a 1
is appended to the front and back.

Example
For the value 5, the desired representation is as follows:

[ 1 ]

[1, 1]

[1, 2, 1]

[1, 3, 3, 1]

[1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
