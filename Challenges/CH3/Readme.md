## CH3: Kilometer-per-Liter
A car’s kilometer-per-Liter (KPL) can be calculated with the following formula:

                            KPL = Kilometer driven ÷ gas used in Liter

Write a program that asks the user for the number of kilometers driven and the liters of gas used. It should calculate the car's KPL and display the result.
